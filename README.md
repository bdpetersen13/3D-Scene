# 3D Scene: Tea Set

For my final project in the CS330: Computational Graphics and Visualization at SNHU, I rendered a 3D scene from a selected 2D image.


# Purpose

This final project aimed to recreate a 3D scene from a selected 2D image. The 2D image I chose contained a tea set: a teapot, two teacups, a container, and a serving tray.

When designing the program involved breaking down the overall project into smaller, manageable components and identifying the requirements and constraints for each element. This process involved creating diagrams, flowcharts, and prototypes to help visualize the design and gather feedback. In addition, when developing the scene, it was essential to prioritize the design's modularity, scalability, and maintainability to ensure the software could adapt to changing needs over time.

When working on this project, C++ and modern OpenGL were used to render the 3D scene. Utilizing these tools helped develop my 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, and shader programming skills. Additionally, the project helped improve my software design and architecture skills, such as creating modular, reusable code and optimizing performance.

The design approach I used for the project can also be applied to future software projects. For example, breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable components, identifying requirements, and creating modular, scalable, and maintainable code are all critical design tactics that can be used in various software projects.

When it comes to developing programs, it typically involves writing code to implement the design, testing the code to ensure it meets the requirements and functions as intended, and optimizing performance. Therefore, it's essential to follow best practices for coding, such as commenting code, using version control, and testing thoroughly to catch errors early on.

Iteration is an integral part of the development process, allowing you to refine and improve your code based on feedback and testing. For the project, iteration by first rendering the objects into the 3D scene, then adding a camera and input devices, then adding texture to the scene, and next lighting and shading were added, lastly tweaks and adjustments needed were made.

My approach when developing code evolved as I better understood the project requirements, identified potential performance bottlenecks and received feedback from my professor and other students. Iterating on the code, testing frequently, and refactoring code to make it more modular and maintainable can all contribute to a more efficient and effective development process.

## Getting Started

To get started, you must clone this repository to your chosen place on your local device.

In the files, you will find a .exe file that will run the program showcasing the rendered 3D scene.

Additionally, the project was created using Visual Studio, and the project file can be opened with Visual Studio. Once opened, the application must be built on the new device.

## Usage

First, opening the application, the 3D scene will be rendered in the initial camera position. 

The user can interact with the scene by utilizing the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', 'Q', and 'E' keys which will move forwards, left, backward, right, pan up, and pan down. Additionally, the user can manipulate the camera position and orientation with the mouse cursor by activating the left mouse button and moving the cursor around the scene.
